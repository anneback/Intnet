Project in course DD2390: Internet programming with Carl Henrik Klåvus

This is an app that simulates a simple shopping application of DOTA2 items for completing the course DD2390: Internet programming, held at Kungliga Tekniska högskolan. 

This is NOT an application for any commercial purposes, but purely educational. We only wanted to learn more about crafting apps and understanding the other processes around it. We DO NOT own any rights of the pictures in this application.
